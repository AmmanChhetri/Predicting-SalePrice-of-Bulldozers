This is a famous time-series analysis problem of Kaggle...used various machine learning models like RandomForestRegressor, CatBoostRegessor, XGBoostRegressor....along with the RandomizedSearchCV and with log-Scaling....and was able to get a minimum Root-Mean-Squarred-log-error(required evaluation metric) as 0.24 .
